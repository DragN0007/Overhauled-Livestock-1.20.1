Camels are far faster than horses on sand, and can be right-clicked with a bucket every 5 minutes~ for water. Camels are also immune to cactus damage. $(br2)They come in lots of different patterns and colors. You can tame and breed Camels with cacti and multiple Camels can be put into a caravan, like Llamas."
