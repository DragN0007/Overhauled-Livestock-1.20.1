Unicorns also have much higher stats than horses, and can be killed for Unicorn Horns and meat. Unicorns come in three different species corresponding to the three dimensions. Whilst Unicorns can come in all colors and patterns that an O-Horse can, they generally come in colors corresponding to their dimension. $(br2)Overworld: Light, Soft Colors. Takes Heart of the Sea, Amethyst Clusters, or Emeralds as tame food. $(br)Nether: Dark, Heavy Colors. Takes Netherite Scrap, Gold Blocks, or Quartz Blocks as tame food. $(br)End: Mid-Toned, Desaturated Colors. Takes End Crystals, Dragon Breath, or Ender Pearls as tame food."
